      <h4 class="paraTitle">02.Review process</h4>
      <p>The review process will be double-blind. Each paper is submitted to one of the given tracks. Each submission
        will receive at least three independent reviews in the track. The goal of the review step is to provide
        constructive evaluation of a submitted paper. Each submission will also receive a composite score in addition to
        a comprehensive review. The submission will be discussed between the PC members who reviewed the paper and the
        track chairs, and submissions in each track will be ranked based on factors including technical merits,
        originality of work, potential impact of results, quality of execution, quality of presentation, adequacy of
        citations, and reproducibility, and recommended for presentation at the conference and awards.
        Accepted submissions will comprise sets of full papers (maximum of 10 pages) with oral presentations, and short
        papers (maximum of 6 pages) with poster presentations. Some full-paper submissions may be accepted as short
        papers. Author consent to accept full-paper submissions as short papers will be sought during full-paper
        submission.</p>
